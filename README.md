Software design document outlines data pertaining to extending client The Gaming Room's application "Draw it or Lose it" to an online environment. Document discusses pros and cons of different operating platforms in terms of hosting and developing the application.
Document does well to describe pros and cons of different architectures of application development via the "Recommendations" section.
"Evaluation" section could use improvement; more data could be provided to better outline the pros and cons of each operating system, specifically in terms of hosting and developing software.
The design template outlines many evaluations outside of coding, and thus is able to aid in recognizing and building upon the different elements of what is required to develop the specific type of software. Because the document evaluates elements outside of coding, it is a good guideline for providing insight on the development process that leads up to the act of writing code, expediting the coding process by providing a reference point for what is required to properly build the software.
